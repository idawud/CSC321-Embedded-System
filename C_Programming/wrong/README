As the name of this directory indicates, there is something wrong with this
attempt to calculate the Fibonacci numbers. You can try to compile the program
(it will compile with no errors) and run it.
If it does not crash it will in any case not calculate the Fibonacci series
if you are not extremely lucky.
I wrote this program to allow you playing with a debugger which should allow
to finde the bug, but maybe you see it by just looking at the code?
