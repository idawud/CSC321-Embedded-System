You must understand what switch.c does!
switch-1.c is quite a bit more tricky and maybe goes beyond what you have
learned so far. ... since you are all expert C++ programmers you may actually
understand the code. If after trying hard you do not understand then just
forget about. At the end of the semester you will understand!
If you know what a Makefile is then you may try to understand what I do in
there, if not you will have to wait until the next lecture, where I will explain
make and Makefiles.
